## Build & Deploy

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Start Vite dev server
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build      # Generates static HTML/CSS/JS in /public
```

### Deployment to Hostinger
The `hostinger` branch must contain ONLY the contents of `/public`:

```bash
# After building, copy /public contents to hostinger branch root
# The Hostinger Git Tool deploys the branch root directly to public_html
```

## Important Rules

1. **Static Export Only**: All HTML is generated by `scripts/export-static.mjs` during `npm run build`
2. **No Manual HTML**: Never create .html files in the repo
3. **Relative Links**: All internal links must be relative (no leading `/`)
4. **No React Router**: This is a multi-page static site (MPA)
5. **Two Subsites**: Main site at root, TeamWorks at `/teamworks`

## Technology

- **React** - For component development (compiled to static HTML)
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling via CDN in generated HTML
- **Vanilla JS** - Client-side interactivity in generated static site

## Migration Status

Currently migrating from scattered structure (`src/main-site`, `src/teamworks`, `src/app`) to unified `src/site` structure. Some components still use temporary re-exports during transition.
